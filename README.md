# Elevator Jump - Just jump in the right moment to survive...
Have you ever wondered if you could survive an elevator freefall by jumping at the last possible moment?
It’s a question that’s fascinated me for as long as I can remember. ALso, I wanted to check out pygame.
While physics tells us that the necessary reaction time and force make it impossible in real life, this game imagines a world where perfect reflexes can defy the laws of nature. 

In Elevator Jump, your only goal is to leap to safety—just before the elevator crashes. 
### Timing is everything. Can you make the jump?
